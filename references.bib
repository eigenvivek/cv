  abstract = {A connectome is a map of the structural and/or functional connections in the brain. This information-rich representation has the potential to transform our understanding of the relationship between patterns in brain connectivity and neurological processes, disorders, and diseases. However, existing computational techniques used to analyze connectomes are oftentimes insufficient for interrogating multi-subject connectomics datasets: most current methods are either solely designed to analyze single connectomes, or leverage heuristic graph statistics that are unable to capture the complete topology of connections between brain regions. To enable more rigorous connectomics analysis, we introduce a set of robust and interpretable statistical hypothesis tests motivated by recent theoretical advances in random graph models. These tests facilitate simultaneous analysis of multiple connectomes across different levels of network topology, enabling the robust and reproducible discovery of hierarchical brain structures that vary in relation with phenotypic profiles. In addition to explaining the theoretical foundations and guarantees of our hypothesis tests, we demonstrate their superiority over current state-of-the-art connectomics methods through extensive simulation studies, as well as synthetic and real-data experiments. Using a set of high-resolution connectomes obtained from genetically distinct mouse strains (including the BTBR mouse -- a standard model of autism -- and three behavioral wild-types), we illustrate how our methods can be used to successfully uncover latent information in multi-subject connectomics data and yield valuable insights into the connective correlates of neurological phenotypes. The code necessary to reproduce the analyses, simulations, and figures presented in this work are available in a series of Jupyter Notebooks (https://github.com/neurodata/MCC).},

This information-rich representation has the potential to transform our understanding of the relationship between patterns in brain connectivity and neurological processes, disorders, and diseases. However, existing computational techniques used to analyze connectomes are often insufficient for interrogating multi-subject connectomics datasets. Several methods are either solely designed to analyze single connectomes, or leverage heuristic graph invariants that ignore the complete topology of connections between brain regions. To enable more rigorous comparative connectomics analysis, we introduce robust and interpretable statistical methods motivated by recent theoretical advances in random graph models. These methods enable simultaneous analysis of multiple connectomes across different scales of network topology, facilitating the discovery of hierarchical brain structures that vary in relation with phenotypic profiles. We validated these methods through extensive simulation studies, as well as synthetic and real-data experiments. Using a set of high-resolution connectomes obtained from genetically distinct mouse strains (including the BTBR mouse -- a standard model of autism -- and three behavioral wild-types), we show that these methods uncover valuable latent information in multi-subject connectomics data and yield novel insights into the connective correlates of neurological phenotypes.},

  abstract = {The data science of networks is a rapidly developing field with myriad applications.  In neuroscience, the brain is commonly modeled as a connectome, a network of nodes connected by edges. While there have been thousands of papers on connectomics, the statistics of networks remains limited and poorly understood.  Here, we provide an overview from the perspective of statistical network science of the kinds of models, assumptions, problems, and applications that are theoretically and empirically justified for analysis of connectome data.  We hope this review spurs further development and application of statistically grounded methods in connectomics.},
