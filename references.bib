  abstract = {The data science of networks is a rapidly developing field with myriad applications.  In neuroscience, the brain is commonly modeled as a connectome, a network of nodes connected by edges. While there have been thousands of papers on connectomics, the statistics of networks remains limited and poorly understood.  Here, we provide an overview from the perspective of statistical network science of the kinds of models, assumptions, problems, and applications that are theoretically and empirically justified for analysis of connectome data.  We hope this review spurs further development and application of statistically grounded methods in connectomics.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) dramatically increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). Several studies have indicated that co-infection with TB increases the risk of HIV progression and death. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of these dual epidemics, with about 2.4 million HIV-infected people living with TB. The main objective of our study was to assess whether the pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and percentages could serve as biomarkers for post-HAART treatment immune-recovery in HIV-positive children with and without TB co-infection.                                         Methods               The data analyzed in this retrospective study were collected from a cohort of 305 HIV-infected children being treated with HAART. A Lehmann family of ROC curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance of pre- HAART treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage as biomarkers for post-HAART immune recovery. The Kaplan\textendash Meier estimator was used to compare differences in post-HAART recovery times between patients with and without TB co-infection.                                         Results               We found that the diagnostic performance of both pre-HARRT treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage was comparable and achieved accuracies as high as 74\%. Furthermore, the predictive capability of pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage were slightly better in TB-negative patients. Our analyses also indicate that TB-negative patients have a shorter recovery time compared to the TB-positive patients.                                         Conclusions               Pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage are stronger predictors of immune recovery in TB-negative pediatric patients, suggesting that TB co-infection complicates the treatment of HIV in this cohort. These findings suggest that the detection and treatment of TB is essential for the effectiveness of HAART in HIV-infected pediatric patients.},

  abstract = {Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality. However, therapeutic benefit of ART is often limited by delayed drug-associated toxicity. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are the backbone of ART regimens. NRTIs compete with endogenous deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) in incorporation into elongating DNA chain resulting in their cytotoxic or antiviral effect. Thus, the efficacy of NRTIs could be affected by direct competition with endogenous dNTPs and/or feedback inhibition of their metabolic enzymes. In this paper, we assessed whether the levels of ribonucleotides (RN) and dNTP pool sizes can be used as biomarkers in distinguishing between HIV-infected patients with ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity and HIV-infected patients without toxicity.},
